4.1 Code Overview
The software implementation involves reading sensor data, processing it against defined thresholds, and controlling the servo motor accordingly. The code includes:

cpp
#include <Servo.h>
#include <NewPing.h>  // Library for ultrasonic sensor

// Pin definitions
const int mq135_analog = A0;    // CO₂ analog output
const int mq135_digital = 2;    // Optional digital pin for threshold
const int servoPin = 6;         // Servo control pin
const int trigPin = 9;          // Ultrasonic sensor trigger pin
const int echoPin = 10;         // Ultrasonic sensor echo pin

// Thresholds and constants
const int co2Threshold = 400;   // Threshold for CO₂ (adjust based on calibration)
const int proximityThreshold = 50; // Distance threshold in cm
const unsigned long doorOpenTime = 5000; // Time door stays open in ms

// Object initialization
Servo doorServo;
NewPing sonar(trigPin, echoPin, 200); // NewPing setup (trigger, echo, max distance in cm)

// Variables
unsigned long doorOpenStartTime = 0;
boolean doorIsOpen = false;

void setup() {
  // Start serial communication for debugging
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Starting Automatic Door System...");
  
  // Servo initialization
  doorServo.attach(servoPin);
  doorServo.write(0);  // Start with door closed
  
  // Pin modes
  pinMode(mq135_analog, INPUT);
  pinMode(mq135_digital, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Read sensor data
  int airQuality = analogRead(mq135_analog);  // Read CO₂ level
  int distance = sonar.ping_cm();  // Read distance in cm
  
  // Print sensor readings for monitoring
  Serial.print("CO₂ Level: ");
  Serial.print(airQuality);
  Serial.print(" | Distance: ");
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.println(" cm");
  
  // Check if door should be opened
  boolean shouldOpenDoor = false;
  
  // Check CO₂ levels
  if (airQuality >= co2Threshold) {
    Serial.println("⚠ High CO₂ detected!");
    shouldOpenDoor = true;
  }
  
  // Check proximity detection (0 means no obstacle detected)
  if (distance > 0 && distance <= proximityThreshold) {
    Serial.println("Person detected!");
    shouldOpenDoor = true;
  }
  
  // Control door based on sensor readings
  if (shouldOpenDoor && !doorIsOpen) {
    openDoor();
  } 
  else if (!shouldOpenDoor && doorIsOpen && (millis() - doorOpenStartTime >= doorOpenTime)) {
    closeDoor();
  }
  
  delay(500);  // Small delay for stability
}

void openDoor() {
  Serial.println("Opening door...");
  doorServo.write(90);  // Open door
  doorIsOpen = true;
  doorOpenStartTime = millis();
}

void closeDoor() {
  Serial.println("Closing door...");
  doorServo.write(0);  // Close door
  doorIsOpen = false;
}
